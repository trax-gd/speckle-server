## Disclaimer

We're working to stabilize the 2.0 API, and until then there will be breaking changes.

## Introduction

This monorepo is the home of the Speckle 2.0 web packages. If you're looking for the desktop connectors, you'll find them [here](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp).

Specifically, this monorepo contains:

### ➡️ [Server](packages/server), the Speckle Server.

The server is a nodejs app. Core external dependencies are a Redis and Postgresql db.

### ➡️ [Frontend](packages/frontend), the Speckle Frontend.

The frontend is a static Vue app.

### ➡️ [Viewer](packages/viewer), the Speckle Viewer.

The viewer is a [threejs](https://threejs.org/) extension that allows you to display data from Speckle. 

## Developing and Debugging

To get started, first clone this repo. Check out the detailed instructions for each module in their respective folder (see links above). 

## Bootsrap local Speckle Server

> prerequisites: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To get a local Server stack up and running quickly:

- clone this repository
- copy `.env-example` file from the server module to the project root and rename to `.env`
- fill out the environment variables in the `.env` file, follow the comment instructions
- run `$ docker-compose up`

This gets you an empty server running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
